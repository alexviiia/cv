# My academic CV LaTeX source files

My *curriculum vitae* is freely available here, including its source code.
Feel free to use this LaTeX code as a template for your own CV!

Compile it using XeLaTeX:
```
xelatex cv
```

My code is derived from the 
[Compact Academic CV](https://www.latextemplates.com/template/compact-academic-cv)
template found at LaTeXTemplates.com, itself derived from the original from
[Dario Taraborelli](http://nitens.org/taraborelli/home).
